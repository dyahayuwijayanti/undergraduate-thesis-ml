# Undergraduate Thesis – Machine Learning

This repository contains machine learning experiments
developed as part of my undergraduate thesis.

The project focuses on classification using tree-based
machine learning models and performance comparison
between different algorithms.

## Models Implemented
- Random Forest (classification)
- XGBoost (classification)

## Model Comparison
A comparative analysis between Random Forest and XGBoost
is provided to evaluate:
- Classification performance
- Confusion matrix results
- Feature importance

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository
due to confidentiality and data privacy considerations.

## Notes
- All experiments were conducted using local datasets.
- File paths in the code refer to local environments.
- This repository is intended for academic and portfolio purposes.
